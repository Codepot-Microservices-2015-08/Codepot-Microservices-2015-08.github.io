Codepot 2015 Workshop
=====================

Welcome to the Codepot 2015 Workshop!

Here you find all information required for you to work during the Codepot 2015 Workshop.

# Link to the presentation

[Presentation about microservices](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZSMaZJrvurvH3-EKuI2DXifKenPVp2xq80uzJvr7yzs/edit?usp=sharing)

# Ok what should I do now? 

## Clone the GIT properties repository to your computer

Clone repositories from https://github.com/Codepot-Microservices-2015-08

Run this command (if you have sent your SSH key to Github)

```
git clone git@github.com:Codepot-Microservices-2015-08/properties.git
```

And the appropriate service i.e. `butelkatr` for `red` team:

```
git clone git@github.com:Codepot-Microservices-2015-08/butelkatr-red.git
```

## Start coding!

Well, let your team pick a service and start coding. Once you commit and push,
Jenkins will build that for you and upload your JAR to nexus. Next Rundeck will
deploy your application to the apps server. 

Each of the microservices will have a predefined port at which it will listen
to requests so you don't have to worry about that.

# How to run my microservice locally

It's all there in the readme - [boot-microservice-readme](https://github.com/4finance/boot-microservice)
